    So I’m more of a newbie as most people would like to say. 
    I began programming in 2022 fresh from school and looking for a new world.
    Within those few years, I’ve been thrown from one aspect of the tech life to another. 
    There’s been no better joy for me than having to shout out again and again “Yeah. I fixed it”. And there are the occasional bugs but then there’s no crop without pests.
    I’ve had the time of my life since then working with the most amazing people, 
    in some of the most amazing places. And nothing beats (well for me)
    providing accessible solutions for the layman

    When I’m not hunched over my old hand me down thank you very much laptop,
    I’m a fiddling poet and creative writer trying to express what I see in poetry and prose
